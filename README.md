# Simple Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles and scripts I use for customizing macOS.


## What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are configuration files on Unix-based systems. At first they are just hidden configuration files of the system (that's why the reason for starting with "."). However, we can use them to make it easier to configure our computers, with many advantages:

* Easy to format a new computer;
* Automation of tasks;
* Easy maintenance;
* Versioning;
* Storage in remote locations (GitHub, Dropbox, etc)


## What's in it?

### Permanent Settings Files:

* Aliases: contains all system aliases;
* Functions: contains custom functions to perform certain tasks with more practicality. Eg: extract files.
* Gitconfig: basic git settings.
* Gitignore: global gitignore.
* Macos: macOS preferences commands.
* VSCode: VSCode editor settings.

### Temporary installation files:
